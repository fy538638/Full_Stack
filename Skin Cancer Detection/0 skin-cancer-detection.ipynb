This in turn has the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. Skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer. If detected early, it is highly treatable.\n\nDeep learning in the field of image processing has shown exceptional results. The aim of this project is to do skin cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning. The goal is to create such a model that it can detect from a scan if the cancer is benign or malignant, so that it is detected and appropriate medical treatment can be provided for its cure.\n\nTensorFlow library is used for the deep learning.
